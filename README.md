## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Description

       When our class begins, we are required to find our teammates. It is not uncommon that we tend to naturally group up with someone from the same universities because of familiarity. However, by grouping up like this, we cannot even get to know each other pretty well. Then this idea comes across us: We can design a cloud-based grouping application for this scenario! We aim to design a system where you can find your teammates based on recommendation!
